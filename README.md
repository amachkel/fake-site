## Technologies Used

* ReactJS
* React-Bootstrap
* NextJS
* Third Party API: Vimeo Videos

## Future Directions

- Adding a secondary page! NextJS makes routing extremely convenient, one would only need to add the new page to the 'pages' directory and it is automatically available as a route. The benefit to writing this with components is it adds a level of scalability for future development.
- Cleaning up CSS(and utilizing React-Bootstrap components more)
- Creating authentication/login capabilities. This would involve setting up a server side with a database. It would also be fun to make a user's and admin's profile page!
